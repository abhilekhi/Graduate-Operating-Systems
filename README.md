### gRPC SERVER AND CACHE SERVICE CALL REQUESTS  					 
•	Created a server and client protocol using gRPC commands using the programming language C++ to store, fetch, list, delete and obtain file attributes between a server and client

•	Implemented a cache strategy to quickly fulfill service calls while ensuring asynchronous calls are accurately communicated 

•	Utilized mutual exclusion philosophy to prevent race conditions within a server and client communication channel  


### CACHE AND PROXY COMMUNICATION AND FILE TRANSFER 					  
•	Created a cache and proxy using the programming language C 

•	Utilized socket communication for low-level communications whereas data transfer was done using POSIX semaphores and a shared memory struct

•	Enhanced processing speed by using a multithreaded configuration which follows similarly to a boss-worker framework

•	Successfully transferred varying file sizes of images and documents
